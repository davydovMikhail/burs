# Basic Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
TOKEN_ADDR="0xA994773AA6ea0E3b7Cfa3110702a486d99500D67"
BURSE_ADDR="0x5E4f050C2609c353490822839E2367cE8E070FCD"
```
